I am *Andrea Brancaleoni*, a software engineer and security researcher at [.Cleafy](http://cleafy.com).

I have a master's degree in Computer Science and Engineering from Politecnico di Milano.

During the last year, I developed my master's thesis project at [NECST Laboratory](http://necst.it/): a secure Linux® dynamic memory allocator using ARM™ TrustZone™. I worked under the supervision of [Stefano Zanero](http://home.deib.polimi.it/zanero/eng/) and [Federico Maggi](https://maggi.cc/).

My professional interests revolve around software methodologies and programming languages, physical and software security, algorithms and data structures.

I am an open source ambassador and VoidLinux package maintainer.
In fact, I contributed to dozens of open source projects.
